                        <p>Signal processing consists of representation and transformation of signals and the
                            information
                            that they carry. Over the years, signal processing has immensely developed to provide
                            phenomenal
                            growth in the area of microchips, digital systems and computer hardware.

                            <br>
                            The applications of signal processing are vast and interdisciplinary-ranging from
                            engineering to
                            economics and astronomy to biology. The research in areas such as signal coding and
                            de-noising
                            have paved the path for these advancements.

                            Recent decade has witnessed major revolution in communication and processing of digital
                            media.
                            As a consequence, solution to major problems in processing, transmission and reception have
                            made
                            signal processing an integral part of modern electronic and communication systems.
                            Communication
                            on the other hand plays major role in our day to day life. The communication technology
                            helps in
                            the advancement of modern systems to meet our need of efficient exchange of ideas. The
                            current
                            research includes the areas of cognitive radio and IOT.

                            There is a need for providing a forum to scientists and researchers to discuss and put
                            forward
                            their ideas and research findings with the co-researchers from all over the world. ICSC 2022
                            will provide an opportunity to highlight recent developments and to identify emerging and
                            future
                            areas of growth in these fields. It will further give impetus to the researchers for
                            proposing
                            novel efficient techniques.
